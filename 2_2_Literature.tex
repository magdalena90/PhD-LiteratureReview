\subsection{Literature reviewed}\label{Literature}

Table \ref{table:LiteratureByTopic} shows a summary of the group of topics each of the reviewed papers studied. The number in each cell represents the total number of papers that studied the topic (or group of topics) in its corresponding row plus the topic (or group of topics) in its corresponding column, colouring grey the cells that do not provide any new information to the table due to symmetry, the last row and column display the total counts, the second one showing the total by paper and the first one the total by topic\footnote{Since many papers study more than one topic, these total counts will be higher than the ones by paper.}, and the last cell shows the sum of totals, both by topic (left number) and by paper (right number).

Independently of the topics studied, the most common objectives of the papers were to gain insights into transcriptomic differences in the topic (or topics) their analysis was centred on, and to identify genes or biological pathways related to this topic (or topics).
