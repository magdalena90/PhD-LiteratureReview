\section{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}

Pending questions/experiments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It might help to have autism samples labelled into different ASD categories to study the specific genetic components of each category. Perhaps part of the high variation found in gene expression in the disease is in part because of this. Also, a more robust definition of ASD across experiments could help to reduce bias between datasets. (Although there isn't anything we could actually do about this, just point it out)

\item Decide which dataset/datasets to use (including other modalities): The two closest models didn't use a database with autism samples, but perhaps including ASD samples will influence the construction of the modules, clustering together genes that have similar changes in expression in ASD patients and this will improve the classification

\item Propose developing a new model with a combination of the models listed on Section \ref{Methods} that satisfies all the characteristics of the ideal model

\item Perhaps perform module enrichment analysis to the genes found to be related to ASD in our model to see if a specific module is over represented and its corresponding biological process could be related to ASD
\end{itemize}
